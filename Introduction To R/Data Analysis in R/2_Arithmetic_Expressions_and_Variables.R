# Task 1a - Calculate the combined quantity of mangoes and lemons available on day two. Refer to the item available column for the values.
print(47L + 476L)

# Task 1b - Determine the ratio between the purchase and selling prices of lemons. Use the values from the purchase price and selling price columns.
print(3.20 / 4.99)

# Task 2 - Assuming the selling price of lemon is $5, determine the number of lemons sold if the total sales for a day amounted to $128.
print(128 %/% 5)

# Task 3 - Calculate the individual total costs of 
# (a) Purchasing apples on day one
print(10.50 * 200L)
# (b) Purchasing mangoes on day one
print(21.15 * 50L)
# (c) Purchasing lemons on day one
print(3.20 * 500L)
# (d) The overall costs of purchasing all fruits on day one
print(2100 + 1057.5 + 1600)

# Task 4 - Determine the .. 
# (a) Predicted selling cost of apples on day one
print(12.10 * 200L)
# (b) Predicted selling cost of mangoes on day one
print(24.90 * 50L)
# (c) Predicted selling cost of lemons on day one
print(4.99 * 500L)
# (d) Overall predicted selling cost of all fruit on day one
print((12.10 * 200L) + (24.90 * 50L) + (4.99 * 500L))

# Task 5 - 
# (a) Total cost of purchasing all fruits on day one:
total_purchase_cost <- 10.50 * 200L + 21.15 * 50L + 3.20 * 500L
# (b) Total anticipated revenue from selling all fruit on day one:
total_selling_cost <- 12.10 * 200 + 24.90 * 50 + 4.99 * 500
# (c) Overal profit
profit_1 <- total_selling_cost - total_purchase_cost

# Task 6 - Determining classes:
q_1 <- class(total_purchase_cost)
